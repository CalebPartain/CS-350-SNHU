# CS-350-SNHU
I was tasked with creating a prototype thermostat that could simulate interacting with a server and automatically turning on a heater based on the temperature in the room. I feel that I actually coded the project quite well. Admittedly, there were some confusing aspects to the project that I had to research thoroughly to understand. I wish to better understand the entire setup instead of just using what I was given. While it wouldnâ€™t be necessary, I feel it would make me a stronger computer scientist. I will definitely be using the TI board in some future personal projects, but being able to work with the board will certainly help me in my future courses. Time management is very important in the completion of this course. It is a good amount of work and will require an allotted portion of your week to complete.
